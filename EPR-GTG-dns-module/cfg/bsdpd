# bsdPanel sample config file

# This first one is special, in that it is used by the bsdPanel daemon

# Format:

# <sub-system name> {
#       id: <number>;                           # Any number that is not taken by the core sub-systems (06 - 99)
#       program: bin/something;                 # Full path, or take workingdir/<program>. So /usr/local/bsdpanel/bin/something in this example.
#       arguments: -user xistence;              # Pass an arbitrary amount of arguments to the program to be executed
#       env: SPECIALSAUCE=yes,MAYO=no;          # Pass environment variables to the executing program.

# It is important to remember to close the brackets, and to add a semi-colon to the end of each of the different variables.
# to use a semi-colon in a variable, precede it with a backslash (\).
