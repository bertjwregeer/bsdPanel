Idea for public_html folder

apache supports userdir
so if user has more than one domain name then
~username takes them to a public_html folder in which a php file runs and reads their domains folder and gets the names of their domains. From this it then produces a list of domains
something like this.


Here are your domains. Click one to view the contents of this site.


Either that or when a new domain name is created a symlink is also created
for example mysupaleetdomain.com is created

domains/mysupaleetdomain.com/public_html is created
public_html/mysupaleetdomain.com -> ../domains/mysupaleetdomain.com/public_html is also created
